Add your CSS pipeline entrypoints here. For Tailwind or Bootstrap, point your build
steps to this location.

### Tailwind standalone workflow

1. Download the Tailwind standalone binary for your platform. For example (macOS arm64):

   ```sh
   curl -L -o tailwindcss \
     https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/download/v4.1.1/tailwindcss-macos-arm64
   chmod +x tailwindcss
   ```

2. Generate CSS from `input.css`:

   ```sh
   ./tailwindcss -i web/assets/styles/input.css -o public/assets/styles/output.css --watch
   ```

   Adjust the paths as needed to match your build setup.

### Basecoat tweaks

Basecoat's core styles load from the CDN links in `web/templates/pages/index.html`.
Place any overrides or Tailwind-powered extensions beneath the `@import` line in
`web/assets/styles/input.css`, then rebuild so they land in
`public/assets/styles/output.css`.

### DaisyUI standalone

DaisyUI compiles through the Tailwind CLI installed by the fast script. Drop any
project-specific rules into `public/assets/styles/custom.css`â€”it's linked after
the generated bundle so your overrides take precedence.

The `make go` target runs `curl -sL daisyui.com/fast | bash -s -- ./web/assets/styles` the first time you
boot the dev server, matching the standalone quick-start instructions.
