# {{ .AppName }}

Generated with **fullkek** using the **{{ .Stack.Name }}** stack.

> This scaffold wires the project for a hypermedia-first workflow. Templates, assets,
and transport logic are stubbed out so you can focus on implementing the UI layer
that best fits the stack.

## Stack

- {{ range $index, $tag := .Stack.Tags }}{{ if $index }}, {{ end }}{{ $tag }}{{ end }}

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```
{{if has "Tailwind" .Stack.Tags}}
For Tailwind CSS, download the standalone binary:

```bash
make tailwind-install
```

Then build your CSS (or watch for changes):

```bash
make tailwind-build    # Build once
make tailwind-watch    # Watch and rebuild on changes
```

Run Tailwind and the Go server together (installs Tailwind if needed):

```bash
make go
```
{{end}}
Run the development server:

```bash
make dev
# or
go run ./cmd/server
```

These commands attempt to open `http://localhost:3333` in your default browser. Override `APP_URL`
when running `make` if you change the listen address, or export `BROWSER=echo` to suppress opening.

The server will start on `http://localhost:3333`

## Available Commands

Run `make help` to see all available commands:

- `make dev` - Run development server with auto-reload
- `make go` - Start development server and Tailwind watcher (if enabled)
- `make build` - Build the application binary
- `make run` - Build and run the application
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts{{if has "Tailwind" .Stack.Tags}}
- `make tailwind-install` - Download standalone Tailwind CSS binary
- `make tailwind-watch` - Watch and rebuild Tailwind CSS on changes
- `make tailwind-build` - Build Tailwind CSS once{{end}}

## Next Steps

1. Explore the `internal/app` package to understand the application structure
1. Add routes and handlers in `internal/transport/http/router.go`
1. Create HTML templates under `web/templates/`
1. Customize styles in `web/assets/styles/`
{{- if .Stack.HasFeature "database-sqlite" }}
1. Review the helpers in `internal/infrastructure/sqlite/sqlite.go`
{{- end }}
{{if has "Tailwind" .Stack.Tags}}
1. Use Tailwind utility classes in your templates
1. Run `make go` during development to serve the app and rebuild CSS

## Notes
{{if has "Tailwind" .Stack.Tags}}
### Tailwind CSS

This project uses the standalone Tailwind CSS binary (no npm required!). The binary is downloaded from the [official Tailwind CSS GitHub releases](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases) and placed in the `bin/` directory.

- Input CSS: `web/assets/styles/input.css`
- Output CSS: `public/assets/styles/output.css`
- The output CSS is generated from the input and your HTML templates and is served from the `public/` directory

The Makefile automatically detects your OS and architecture and downloads the correct binary.

{{- if .Stack.HasFeature "database-sqlite" }}
### SQLite Persistence

The `internal/infrastructure/sqlite` package provides a focused entry point for
bootstrapping a SQLite database with sqlx. It applies WAL mode, busy timeouts,
and foreign key enforcement by default, storing data under `var/data/` (ignored
by git). Override the DSN or connection pool settings via `sqlite.Config` to fit
your deployment environment. The driver uses CGO, so ensure the relevant SQLite
toolchain is available when building or cross-compiling.
{{- end }}
{{if has "Basecoat" .Stack.Tags}}
### Basecoat Components

Basecoat ships through a CDN link and optional script that are already referenced
from the generated templates. Update the CDN version in your HTML if you want to
pin a newer release. Extend component styles via Tailwind in
`web/assets/styles/input.css`—your changes will compile into
`public/assets/styles/output.css` while keeping Basecoat defaults.
